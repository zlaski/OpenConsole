  # If we are building a branch called "release-*", change the NuGet suffix
  # to "preview". If we don't do that, XES will set the suffix to "release1"
  # because it truncates the value after the first period.
  # We also want to disable the suffix entirely if we're Release branded while
  # on a release branch.
  # main is special, however. XES ignores main. Since we never produce actual
  # shipping builds from main, we want to force it to have a beta label as
  # well.
